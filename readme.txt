Here is my very untidy Altair 8800 emulator project solution.
I am not at all happy with the awful state of the code in this project, but I really do not have the time to get it in a state that doesn't make me cringe. There are almost certainly still bugs and glitches, so don't expect too much. Nothing is code documented either.

The code (such as it is) is completely public domain and open, so do with it as you will.

The project should be completelty self-contained and only requires the NuGet NAudio package to be installed for the cassette audio feature. This should be automatically installed when you first open the project in Visual Studio 2022, but if not, just open the NuGet project manager and install it.

I'd recommend building for x64 platforms.
